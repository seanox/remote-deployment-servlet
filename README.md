# Description

In some cases where deployment with modern containers is not yet possible, a
JEE application can be updated with the manager because a restart of the
application server is required, command line execution is needed, or the
application is so large that it cannot be transferred with the upload load
limit, for example, for continuous delivery. For these cases, the Remote
Deployment Servlet has been created.
